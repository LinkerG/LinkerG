<h2>Projects I've worked in:</h2>
<h3>RemCat:</h3>
RemCat is a website developed with Laravel for the management of rowing competitions in Catalonia, both league and championship, as well as other non-federal regattas.<br>
All the data is stored in a Mongo database and the design of the site is mainly built with Bootstrap.<br>
The environment is built in Docker, so you can also <a href="https://github.com/LinkerG/RemCat">try the site</a> from my repository.<br>
<h3>YetIPhone:</h3>
YetIPhone is an online shop for the sale of mobile phones. Since this was a starter project, it was built with a handmade model-view-controller in php and pure CSS and JS.
