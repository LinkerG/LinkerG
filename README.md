## Soft Skills
 - **Time management:** I am able to plan my daily schedule in order to work efficiently and meet my deadlines.
 - **Teamwork:** With over a decade of experience as a member of a rowing team, I have honed my ability to set collective goals and collaborate effectively to achieve them.
 - **Problem solving and critical thinking:** When I have a problem, I am able to take several steps back to look at it from a different perspective.

## What am I interested in?
 - I am very interested in learning about both app and web mobile development.
 - I also love being involved in challenging projects that make me grow as a developer and as a person.
 - More as a passion, I'd like to try to develop some kind of videogame one day.
