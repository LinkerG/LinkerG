## Soft Skills
 - **Time management:** I am able to plan my daily schedule in order to work efficiently and meet my deadlines.
 - **Teamwork:** With over a decade of experience as a member of a rowing team, I have honed my ability to set collective goals and collaborate effectively to achieve them.
 - **Problem solving and critical thinking:** When I have a problem, I am able to take several steps back to look at it from a different perspective.

## Projects I've worked in
 - <h3>RemCat:</h3><p>RemCat is a website developed with Laravel for the management of rowing competitions in Catalonia, both league and championship, as well as other non-federal regattas.</p><p>All the data is stored in a Mongo database and the design of the site is mainly built with Bootstrap.</p><p>The environment is built in Docker, so you can also <a href="https://github.com/LinkerG/RemCat">try the site</a> from my repository.</p>
 - <h3>YetIPhone:</h3><p>YetIPhone is an online shop for the sale of mobile phones. Since this was a starter project, it was built with a handmade model-view-controller in php and pure CSS and JS.</p>

## What am I interested in?
 - I am very interested in learning about both app and web mobile development.
 - I also love being involved in challenging projects that make me grow as a developer and as a person.
 - More as a passion, I'd like to try to develop some kind of videogame one day.
